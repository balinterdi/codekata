Product

A Product has a Price, and can have a Discount.
Cost is how much one should pay for a certain amount (a Purchase) of the Product.
(e.g if bean cans are for $0.4, or 3 for $1, 2 bean cans cost $0.8, 3 bean cans cost $1, 4 bean cans cost $1.4)

In this setup, Price and Cost are the same thing.

Discount
- type
    - normal
    - every xth free (None, 2, 3, ...)
    - bundle (e.g 3 for $1)
